CSU-OReilly-Safari-Bookshelf-Drupal-module
Author: Rob deMallac

This is my first project on GitHub.  Go easy. ;-)

This is a Drupal module to access O'Reilly's Safari Bookshelf.  It provides a little carosel slideshow of book covers which function as links to the corresponing titles online.  This only works if you are on the CSU's network.
